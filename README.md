Capabilities of the chatbot

Successfully extracts a small dataset of traing and testing data from a large dataset
Successfully Exctracts Features from this subset of large dataset
The model is trained to get a very low log loss  which signifies that model correctly classifies and does not overfit
We analyze the relation between the size training data and the time it takes to train the model 
We also analyze the relation between the size training data and the log loss
